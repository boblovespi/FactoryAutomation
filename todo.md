## [WorldGenHandler.java](/src/main/java/boblovespi/factoryautomation/common/worldgen/WorldGenHandler.java):
 * Eliminate the deprecated methods / fields.
 * Limonite ore-generation, (Me, Qboi123 can't do that because it's too advanced part for me: creating custom features) Maybe someone can do it for me.
 * `#loadIntoBiomes`: maybe use `Feature.FOREST_ROCK` for the `FABlocks.rock` feature generation.
