#so here is my ideas! add the ability to "render" icons/items in the descriptions. heres some default icon idea:
#define the icons by <>
#a hp icon (from the hud) <icon.hud=heart_full> (why "full"? because a heart icon can be full, half or empty)
#a hunger bar (also from the hud) <icon.hud=hungerbar_full> (why full? same as heart)
#here are the eamples for items, using item id: <icon.item=minecraft.diamond_sword> (this makes a diamond sword)
#or a modded one: <icon.item=factoryautomation.steel_ingot>
#and/or can render blocks too: <icon.block=minecraft.brick_block> (using the block id. same, works with modded ones)
#and, the harder one. from texture. needs defining a path for the file (with name), and the texture cordinates (by pixels).
#here is the example: <icon.texture={[assets:factoryautomation\textures\icons\icon_sheet.png];[size=16;0.0,16.16]}>
#the syntax of it: <icon.texture={[file path];[size;x1.y1,x2.y2]}> the size of the file can any, you just define the icon's size what needs to be loaded.
#so you can have a 213px by 56px texture, you just define your icon's texture size. (can be the default minecraft sizes. like 16x16, 32x32, 64x64 etc...)
#and the cordinates of the usable texture. its defines the starting (left upper corner) point and ending(right bottom corner) point,
#this area need to be the selected size, or else will not work.

#AND! the rendered items not that large as the real items, their size is a height of a uppercase letter. same with hud parts, blocks and custom textures.

#i wish you can implement those ideas, it wuld be very cool to have.
#if my syntax ideas bad, or simply just "this is not how it works", well, if you do them, leave this text here and just replace the syntax examples.
#and if those things works, we could release this description tool as a standalone mod.
#i think so many people would like it to use.
