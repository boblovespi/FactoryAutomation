The minimum required volume inside a chamber, is 1x1x1 blocks (since you cant build smaller than a block), but you can build it bigger (Right now, a 50x55x1 chamber crashes the game. The world can be loaded without any problems after that). after you built your chamber, place a so called Limonite-Charcoal mix (which you can craft in a Stone Workbench), light it on fire and cover it up.",
